## How to solve?

Just try your best to solve the exercises every day. Most exercises are simple and can be solved in less than 30 minutes. Whenever you get stuck or feel you are not familiar with the subject, try to search a similar exercise online and learn more about it. Many similar questions are available on leetcode and other websites, so take advantage of that and get ready for the next coding interview :D !
